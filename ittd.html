                    Impact Texas Teen Drivers (ITTD) was developed by the Department of Public Safety with the goal of saving lives through awareness and education. The intent of the program is meant to educate young or new drivers in an effort to reduce the risk of being involved in automobile crashes, particularly those caused by distracted driving.
                    <br><br><br>
                    ITTD is a <span class="highlight">2 hour informational video that  is a prerequisite to the drive skills  examination being administered by the Department or a <a href="http://www.dps.texas.gov/DriverLicense/tpstPrgm.htm">Third Party Skills Testing (TPST) authorized school.</a></span> ITTD must be viewed after you have received your DE-964, showing completion of a Teen Driver Education course.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Upon completion of the ITTD program you will receive a Certificate of Completion that must be presented prior to administering the drive skills examination. The ITTD Certificate of Completion must be dated within 90 days of the administered skills examination.
                    <br><br><br>
                    ITTD is available through a Third Party Skills Testing (TPST) authorized school or the <a href="https://impacttexasteendrivers.dps.texas.gov/">Department’s Impact Texas Teen Drivers website.</a>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span>ATTENTION:</span> Effective September 1, 2015, if you are taking a teen driver education course, you must complete the ITTD requirement before you will be eligible to take the driving skills exam. This requirement to complete ITTD includes individuals aged 18-24, who choose to complete a teen driver education course.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span>NOTE:</span> ITTD does not replace the distracted driving module given in the 32 hours of driver education classroom phase. This program has been added to emphasize the ever increasing dangers of distracted driving.
